# Chess-Validator-JS
A lightweight JavaScript chess engine for validating moves, detecting checks, checkmates, and stalemates.  This project is built from scratch without relying on libraries like chess.js, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize for your own chess applications (UIs, bots, or game analysis).
